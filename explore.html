        <h1>What is Art??</h1>
        <p>
          Art is a highly diverse range of human activities engaged in creating
          visual, auditory, or performed artifacts— artworks—that express the
          author's imaginative or technical skill, and are intended to be
          appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.
        </p>

        <p>
          The oldest documented forms of art are visual arts, which include
          images or objects in fields like painting, sculpture, printmaking ,
          photography, and other visual media . Architecture is often included
          as one of the visual arts; however, like the decorative arts, it
          involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of
          use are essential, in a way that they usually are not in another
          visual art, like a painting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Art may be characterized in terms of mimesis (its representation of
          reality), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities.
          Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed and has
          changed over time, general descriptions center on the idea of
          imaginative or technical skill stemming from human agency and
          creation. When it comes to visually identifying a work of art, there
          is no single set of values or aesthetic traits. A Baroque painting
          will not necessarily share much with a contemporary performance piece,
          but they are both considered art.
        </p>

        <p>
          Art is often examined through the interaction of the principles and
          elements of art. The principles of art include movement, unity,
          harmony, variety, balance, contrast, proportion and pattern. The
          elements include texture, form, space, shape, color, value and line.
          The various interactions between the elements and principles of art
          help artists to organize sensorially pleasing works of art while also
          giving viewers a framework within which to analyze and discuss
          aesthetic ideas.

        <h2>What Makes Art Beautiful?</h2>
        <p>
          Beauty in terms of art refers to an interaction between line, color,
          texture, sound, shape, motion, and size that is pleasing to the
          senses.
        </p>

        <p>
          What makes art beautiful is a complicated concept, since beauty is
          subjective and can change based on context. However, there is a basic
          human instinct, or internal appreciation, for harmony, balance, and
          rhythm which can be defined as beauty. Beauty in terms of art usually
          refers to an interaction between line, color, texture , sound, shape,
          motion, and size that is pleasing to the senses.
        </p>

        <h2>Aesthetic Art!</h2>
        <p>
          Aesthetics is the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature and
          appreciation of art, beauty, and taste. Aesthetics is central to any
          exploration of art. The word "aesthetic" is derived from the Greek
          "aisthetikos," meaning "esthetic, sensitive, or sentient. " In
          practice, aesthetic judgment refers to the sensory contemplation or
          appreciation of an object (not necessarily a work of art), while
          artistic judgment refers to the recognition, appreciation, or
          criticism of a work of art.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beauty in art can be difficult to put into words due to a seeming lack
          of accurate language. An aesthetic judgment cannot be an empirical
          judgment but must instead be processed on a more intuitive level.

        <h2>Art and Human Emotion.</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes beauty is not the artist's ultimate goal. Art is often
          intended to appeal to, and connect with, human emotion. Artists may
          express something so that their audience is stimulated in some
          way—creating feelings, religious faith, curiosity, interest,
          identification with a group, memories, thoughts, or creativity. For
          example, performance art often does not aim to please the audience but
          instead evokes feelings, reactions, conversations, or questions from
          the viewer . In these cases, aesthetics may be an irrelevant measure
          of "beautiful" art.
