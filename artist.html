        <h1>Who Is an Artist??</h1>
        <p>An artist is a person who is involved in the wide range of activities that are related to creating art.The word has transformed over time and context, but the modern understanding of the term denotes that, ultimately, an artist is anyone who calls him/herself an artist.</p>

        <p>In ancient Greece and Rome, there was no word for "artist." The Greek word "techne" is the closest that exists to "art" and means "mastery of any art or craft." From the Latin "tecnicus" derives the English words "technique," "technology," and "technical." From these words we can denote the ancient standard of equating art with manual labor or craft.</p>

        <p>Each of the nine muses of ancient Greece oversaw a different field of human creation. The creation of poetry and music was considered to be divinely inspired and was therefore held in high esteem. However, there was no muse identified with the painting and sculpture; ancient Greek culture held these art forms in low social regard, considering work of this sort to be more along the lines of manual labor.</p>

        <p>During the Middle Ages, the word "artista" referred to something resembling "craftsman," or student of the arts. The first division into "major" and "minor" arts dates back to the 1400s with the work of Leon Battista Alberti, which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills of a craftsman. The European academies of the 16th century formally solidified the gap between the fine and the applied arts, which exists in varying degrees to this day. Generally speaking, the applied arts apply design and aesthetics to objects of everyday use, while the fine arts serve as intellectual stimulation.</p>

        <p>Currently, the term "artist" typically refers to anyone who is engaged in an activity that is deemed to be an art form. However, the questions of what is art and who is an artist are not easily answered. The idea of defining art today is far more difficult than it has ever been. After the exhibition during the Pop Art movement of Andy Warhol's Brillo Box and Campbell's Soup Cans, the questions of "what is art?" and "who is an artist?" entered a more conceptual realm. Anything can, in fact, be art, and the term remains constantly evolving.</p>
